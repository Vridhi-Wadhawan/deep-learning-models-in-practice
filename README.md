# Deep Learning Models in Practice

This repository presents a curated collection of **applied deep learning case studies**, covering multiple neural network paradigms across structured data, text, and images.

Rather than focusing on a single application, this repo demonstrates **breadth of understanding and hands-on implementation** of modern deep learning techniques.

---

## What This Repository Demonstrates

- Practical understanding of **neural network mechanics** (forward and backpropagation)
- Application of **feedforward networks** on structured and business-style datasets
- **Sequential modeling** using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for text data
- **Transfer learning** with pretrained CNNs for image classification
- Model evaluation and comparative reasoning across different data modalities

## Case Studies Included

### 1. Neural Network Fundamentals
Implementation and analysis of forward propagation and backpropagation to build intuition behind gradient-based optimization and learning dynamics.

### 2. Customer Churn Prediction
Binary classification using feedforward neural networks on structured customer data, focusing on feature learning and classification performance.

### 3. Spam Classification
Text classification using Recurrent Neural Networks to capture sequential dependencies in natural language data.

### 4. Image Classification
Image classification using pretrained Convolutional Neural Networks, demonstrating efficient feature reuse and fine-tuning strategies.
